# COSC 341 - Hungry - Ingredients based meal prep/cooking app

This repository is part of COSC 341 Project Step 4. The goal of this step is to design an Android app that allows users to search for cooking recipes based on the ingredients that they enter. The app is targeted towards young people who would benefit from finding easy to cook recipes for weekday or weeknight meals, as well as experienced cooks who wish to share simple and easy to make recipes.
